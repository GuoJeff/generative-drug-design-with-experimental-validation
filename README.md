# Generative Drug (Candidates) Design with Experimental Validation

Compilation of literature examples of generative drug (**candidates**) design that demonstrates experimental validation *at least* *in vitro*. Examples with also *in vivo* validation are specifically noted.

This compilation builds on our [Review Paper](https://rdcu.be/dLah8) and continues to compile literature examples for an up-to-date resource. 

The review article is the result of an awesome collaboration with [Yuanqi Du](https://yuanqidu.github.io/), [Arian Jamasb](https://jamasb.io/), [Tianfan Fu](https://futianfan.github.io/), [Charlie Harris](https://cch1999.github.io/), [Yingheng Wang](https://isjakewong.github.io/), [Chenru Duan](https://www.crduan.com/), [Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), [Philippe Schwaller](https://people.epfl.ch/philippe.schwaller?lang=en), and [Tom L.

<br>

**Examples are presented in chronological order based on the final paper publication date.**
 
 Many papers were first pre-printed on either *ChemRxiv*, *BioRxiv*, or *ArXiv* but for ease of organization, the **final** paper publication date is taken. 
 The only exception is if the paper is still in pre-print stage which is the case for many goal-oriented generation examples because they are so recent (as of writing this statement in June 2024).
